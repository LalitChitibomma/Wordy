# Wordy
Wordy provides a gamified way for students to practice describing concepts and getting feedback on how well they did with AI and natural language processing. 

## Installations

`pip install rake-nltk`
`pip install -U sentence_transformers`

## Quickstart

You only need to use two commands once you're in the main folder

1. `cd app`
2. `python __init__.py`

Have fun with Wordy!
